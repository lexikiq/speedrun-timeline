Check this out.\r\n\r\nTell us about yourself.\r\n\r\nMy name is Joey, though most know me as Kingj0444.  I live in Kitchener, Ontario. I\u2019m 16 years old and in Grade 11. I started my YouTube channel 5 years ago but just recently 3 years ago began taking it more seriously than I did before, uploading one or 2 videos every single day, mainly playing Nintendo game at a PG 13 rating.  In my spare time I like to speedrun some games and aim to set world records in various games I enjoy. I also like interacting with my subscribers by replying to comments on a regular basis to maintain a personal connection with my viewers. I also collect Amiibos and currently have 57 different amiibos as of now.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAre you a gamer and what are your top picks?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYes, I am a big Nintendo Gamer. I started in 2006 with my sister\u2019s GameCube playing Mario Party 4 whenever I happened to be over there. I then ended up getting my own GameCube and continued with Nintendo ever since, getting a Gameboy, Wii and currently a Wii U and a 3DS.  My favourite games right now are The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Final Fantasy 7, yet I always seem to change my mind every now and then.\r\n\r\nHow long have you been creating content? Goals?\r\n\r\nI created my channel back on February 12th, 2012. Back then, I wasn\u2019t very good at sitting in a room alone, talking to myself for 20 minutes at a time, but I quickly learned strengths to apply and grew as a Youtuber over the years. My goals vary depending on the year. Each year I set new goals I want to personally reach within the span of that year. Overall though, I mainly want to grow my community and keep a connection between me and my YouTube fans by committing to being consistent and just being proud of the content I put out and love what I do."}, "y67p876m": {"time": "1:41:41.000", "time_t": 6101, "comment": null}, "y8q9n6ny": {"time": "1:57:16.000", "time_t": 7036, "comment": null}, "zxv456gy": {"time": "1:48:59.000", "time_t": 6539, "comment": "retimed to 1:48"}, "yvgjkqxy": {"time": "3:31:19.000", "time_t": 12679, "comment": "first run and i'm pretty proud of it"}, "y972qx2m": {"time": "2:06:41.000", "time_t": 7601, "comment": null}, "yl90v1xy": {"time": "1:46:29.000", "time_t": 6389, "comment": null}, "mk49nv5y": {"time": "2:33:47.000", "time_t": 9227, "comment": null}, "y67lx80m": {"time": "3:25:11.000", "time_t": 12311, "comment": "Could be better."}, "mrq8w74y": {"time": "1:48:01.000", "time_t": 6481, "comment": null}, "z0e3g6om": {"time": "2:50:52.000", "time_t": 10252, "comment": "Great run"}, "yl9484ny": {"time": "1:52:53.000", "time_t": 6773, "comment": "Red splits all the way!!"}, "y972rjnm": {"time": "2:41:15.000", "time_t": 9675, "comment": null}, "m795w90y": {"time": "2:42:12.000", "time_t": 9732, "comment": null}, "m79pr40y": {"time": "2:37:42.000", "time_t": 9462, "comment": "Legendary"}, "zgn74q0y": {"time": "1:47:02.000", "time_t": 6422, "comment": null}, "mk43nd5y": {"time": "1:58:09.000", "time_t": 7089, "comment": "starts at  28:30\r\nthis is a pb from 2 weeks ago."}, "mk42331y": {"time": "1:59:37.000", "time_t": 7177, "comment": "Skip 30 seconds into the video"}, "yl9041xy": {"time": "2:55:31.000", "time_t": 10531, "comment": "sub 3!
